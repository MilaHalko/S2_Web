          Imagine that you're building a house. One of the first things you
          would do to build a house is put up a frame. There would be nothing
          but plain, wooden beams in the rough shape of a house, and you
          wouldn't be able to live in it yet, but it would give an approximation
          of what the house would eventually look like. The frame would provide
          the foundation you need to keep working.
        </p>

          You can think of HTML as that frame for a webpage. HTML is a computer
          language known as a markup language, and the vast majority of the
          webpages you see on the Internet every day are made of HTML, among
          other things.
